Python examples of isomap algorithm
---
* isomap_faces_tenenbaum: 
Replicate Joshua Tenenbaum's - the primary creator of the isometric feature mapping algorithm -  canonical, dimensionality reduction research experiment for visual perception.
* isomap_aloi:  
Whatever your high-dimensional samples are, be they images, sound files, or thoughtfully collected attributes, they can all be considered single points in a high dimensional feature-space. Each one of your observations is just a single point. Even with a high dimensionality, it's possible that most or all your samples actually lie on a lower dimension surface. Isomap aims to capture that embedding, which is essentially the motion in the underlying, non-linear degrees of freedom.
By testing isomap on a carefully constructed dataset, you will be able to visually confirm its effectiveness, and gain a deeper understanding of how and why each parameter acts the way it does. 
The ALOI, Amsterdam Library of Object Images, hosts a huge collection of 1000 small objects that were photographed in such a controlled environment, by systematically varying the viewing angle, illumination angle, and illumination color for each object separately.
Manifold extraction, and isomap specifically are really good with vision recognition problems, speech problems, and many other real-world tasks, such as identifying similar objects, or objects that have undergone some change.
